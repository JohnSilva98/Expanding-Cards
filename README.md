# Expanding Cards Project

This project is a simple animation where, when you click on a card, it expands, and the previously expanded card retracts.

## ‚ùì How Does It Work?
The panels share two classes: `panel` and `active`.  
With JavaScript, when you click on a panel, the `active` class is added to the clicked panel, and a function is executed to remove the `active` class from the other panels.  

The CSS is responsible for the smooth animation, mainly using a `transition` that increases the width of the clicked element and decreases the width of the others that do not have the `active` class.
